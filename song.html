        We have this hope
        that burns within our hearts
        Hope in the coming of the Lord
        We have this faith that
        Christ alone imparts
        Faith in the promise of His Word

        When the nations far and near
        Shall awake, and shout and sing
        Hallelujah! Chirst is King!

        Hope in the coming of the Lord

        We are united in Jesus Christ our Lord
        We are united in His love
        Love for the waiting people of the world
        People who need our Savior's love

        Soon the heav'ns will open wide
        Christ will come to claim His bride
        All the universe will sing
        Hallelujah! Christ is King!

        We have this hope this
        faith and God's great love
        We are united in Chirst

        Who will his glory share
        Bliss there awaits
        harm can nary fall
        Those who are anchored there

        Kneel at the cross
        Give your idols up
        Look unto realms above
        Turn not away
        to life's sparkling cup
        Trust only in His love

        By His own hand He leadeth me;
        His faithful follower I would be
        For by His hand He leadeth me

        Sometimes 'mid scenes of deepest gloom
        Sometimes where Eden's flowers bloom
        By waters still, o'er troubled sea
        Still 'tis His hand that leadeth me

        Lord, I would claps Thy hand in mine
        Nor ever murmur or repine;
        Content, whatever lot I see
        Since it is Thou that leadest me

        And when my task on earth is done
        When, by Thy grace, the vict'ry's won
        E'en death's cold wave I wil not flee
        Since God in triumph leadest me
